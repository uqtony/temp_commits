refer AOSP comments here
https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/storage/VolumeInfo.java;l=58;drc=master;bpv=0;bpt=1
 * Visible volumes are considered a more stable part of the device, which is why we take the
 * time to index them. In particular, transient volumes like USB OTG devices
 * <em>should not</em> be marked as visible; their contents should be surfaced
 * to apps through the Storage Access Framework
