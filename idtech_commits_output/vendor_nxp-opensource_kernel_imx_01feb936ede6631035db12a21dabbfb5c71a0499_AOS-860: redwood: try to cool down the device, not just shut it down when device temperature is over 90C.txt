AOS-860: redwood: try to cool down the device, not just shut it down when device temperature is over 90C

Symptoms: Unattended device would power off and cannot recover if overheat.
Root Causes: Thermal driver would power off device when reach to critical
temperature.
Solutions:
1. Current bootloader already has mechanism to wait device cooling down.
2. Not power off device but restart instead when overheat.
