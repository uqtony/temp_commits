AOS-20: [Uboot Sign] Update csf_spl.txt csf_fit.txt template files

1. These files are copied from:
    $source/vendor/nxp-opensource/uboot-imx/doc/imx/habv4/csf_examples/mx8m_mx8mm/*
2. Offset info are all removed, we need to fill it
3. The build script will copy them into "UBOOT_OBJ", and add offset into file
4. Ultimately, these files will be inputted into cst tool, and generate .bin files
