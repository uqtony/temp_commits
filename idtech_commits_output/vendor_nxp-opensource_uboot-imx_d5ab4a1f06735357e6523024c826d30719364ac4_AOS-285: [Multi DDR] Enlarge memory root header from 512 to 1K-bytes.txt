AOS-285: [Multi DDR] Enlarge memory root header from 512 to 1K-bytes

  We previously defined first sector (512 Bytes) as root header which indicates
  all objects inside mem_info.img. Since we have more fields to compare,
  each object takes 88 Bytes field size, so we could only put 5 mem objects
  into header.
  We are porting more memory objects into mem_info.img that we need to enlarge
  header block in order to put 5 more memory objects into header.
