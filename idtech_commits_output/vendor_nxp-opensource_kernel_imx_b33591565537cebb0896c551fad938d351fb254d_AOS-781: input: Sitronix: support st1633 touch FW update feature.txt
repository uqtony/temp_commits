- Reference:
  https://gitlab.mingwork.com/hanguoliang/test/commit/d461cec38f1088148aa4b862187083cdd4302f00

- add config to enable this feature:
  CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_ST_FW_UPDATE=y

- be aware of the sequence of st_upgrade_fw:
  1. call st_upgrade_fw after st1232_ts_power on
  2. call st_upgrade_fw after disable_irq if irq is registered
