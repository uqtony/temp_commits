AOS-487: Fix boot fail on pci-user build

Symptom: system_server keep crashing during boot if there is no adbd
Root Cause:
    For PCI build, adbd should physically removed, then device starts service
    fail. Google changed the behavior of failure handle.
      - In Android 10, property_service always send "OK" back to bionic, init
        process just print error log.
      - In Android 11, init gets shared socket and send error message before
        property_service sending "OK" back to bionic. Bionic will receive error
        and raise jni runtime exception.
Solution: Avoiding sending error code back to bionic through socket by init process.
Note: Framework/JNI/Bionic behavior are almost similar between Android 10/11, only
      init process' behavior changed.
